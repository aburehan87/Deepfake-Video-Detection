    |--- Documentaion
```
1. Django Application 
   - This directory consists of the django made application of our work. Where a user can upload the video and submit it to the model for prediction. The trained model performs the prediction and the result is displayed on the screen.
2. Model Creation
   - This directory consists of the step by step process of creating and training a deepfake detection model using our approach.
3. Documentation
   - This directory consists of all the documentation done during the project
